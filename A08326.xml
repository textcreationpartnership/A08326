            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt (ſayth he) the Church receaueth from God inſpiring her, the right ſenſe of Scripture: he muſt firſt decide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy in her mind, before ſhe can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly decide what they are bound to belieue; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirit of God ſpeaking in her hart is the ſupreme Iudge of Controuerſyes, euen in the opinion of vs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes. Secondly, he proueth that the ſame ſpirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> in the diuine word to euery particuler man, was likewiſe iudge in the law of Nature, becauſe at that tyme there were no other ordinations, then ſuch as did neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow out of the eleuating of mankind to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall end: but out of that it no way followes, that al the faythfull were to obey one ſupreme Paſtour. Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third</note> in the law written there was not one Gouernour, the faythfull among the Iewes being without any ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to any one among the Gentills: And the Gentils had no ſubordination to the high Prieſt of the Iewes.<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> Fourthly, it muſt be acknowledged (ſayth he) by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe part, that the ſpirit of God as ſpeaking in particular to euery man, decideth which company of the profeſſors of Chriſtianity is the true Church, and by conſequence<note place="margin">Anſwers.

For which cauſe our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour attributeth the ſame effect and life of our ſoules to one, as he doth to both, ſpeaking only of the bread, he ſayth: <hi>This is the Bread deſcending from heauen, that if any eate of it he may not dye.</hi> Againe: <hi>He that eateth this Bread shall liue for euer.</hi> And S.

                        <p n="2">2. Hence it followeth that the Prieſt receaueth not any more benefite by both kinds then the people by one. For albeit the Chalice by it ſelfe be both the wel &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit of grace: yet taken at the ſame tyme with the body, it infuſeth no more then was enioyed before: Euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of a deuided Hoſt, euery drop of the Chalice is a maine Ocean of ſpirituall bleſſings: yet many of them by the ſame morall action ſucceſſiuely receaued, affoard no more grace then one alone, becauſe that one inſtilleth the whole fountaine it ſelfe which cannot at that tyme be further increaſed, or produced a new. In the miſtery of the Holy Trinity we belieue the ſame; we belieue the vnderſtanding of the Sonne to be alike fruitfull &amp; powerfull as the vnderſtanding of the Father: yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13611:70"/>
not any Image of it ſelfe, any word of the mind, becauſe the true and conſubſtantiall Image, the eternall and perfect word of the vnderſtanding is already begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. So in earthly thinges, where the burning lampe once caſteth his cleareſt beames of light, although it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſtill, it enlightneth no more. Where the fire hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled all degrees of heate, although it worketh ſtill, it can heate no more. In the Holy Sacraments we find the like. When the Character of Baptiſme is once imprinted, let the child be baptized againe, it cannot be imprinted anew. When the body of Chriſt is once conſecrated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formes of Bread, let the wordes be repeated, it cannot be conſecrated againe. After the ſame manner in our <hi>Communion,</hi> when the full and plenteous refection of our ſoule with the whole Body and bloud of Chriſt is by any parcell of either element perfectly accompliſhed, let new Hoſts be imparted, let another element be applyed, as long as the former heauenly repaſt morally nouriſheth and remaineth, we cannot be fed anew, or be more daintily refreſhed. Why then (ſay you) do the Prieſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnder both kindes? I anſwere; Not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more aboundantly the vertue of the Sacrament, but more perfectly to repreſent the Paſſion of Chriſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrity of his Sacrifice, the violent ſeparation of his body &amp; bloud, which is moſt liuely ſignifyed (as I haue already declared) by the ſeuerall conſecration, and ſeparate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of diſtinct and diuers elements.</p>

For wher ſome read: <hi>Whoſoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke the chalice our of Lord vnworthily,</hi> in the Greeke it is (<hi>or drinke.</hi>) And in the immediate chapter before, where the ancient latin copies haue: <hi>We are one bread and one body, all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of one bread, and one Chalice,</hi> the Greeke only readeth, <hi>All that partake of one bread.</hi> Becauſe by one kind we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the true nouriſhment and perfect ſubſtance of both.</p>

For they interpreting S. <hi>Iohns</hi> wordes of the ſpirituall eating of Chriſts fleſh &amp; bloud, by fayth; I would vnderſtand of them, what difference they make betweene eating, and drinking. For certes, in the ſole act of faith, there is no difference: no difference in belieuing his fleſh wounded, from belieuing his bloud ſhed, in reſpect of beliefe: therefore you neither obey the precept, nor feare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſt: <hi>Vnles you eate the fleſh of the Sonne of Man and drinke his bloud, you shall haue no life in you.</hi> Heere Chriſt<note place="margin">

Neuertheleſſe at your importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let vs leaue his words, leaue his meaning, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your falſe conſtruction. Then I propoſe this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether he that ſtedfaſtly belieueth in Chriſt, the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world with one firme aſſent, without ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinking of the wounds of his Body, and effufion of his bloud; doth truly fullfill according to you the former precept, and enioy the promiſed life, or not? Without doubt you muſt graunt he doth, as our Sauiour often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth, ſaying: <hi>He that belieueth in me hath life euerlaſting,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioan. 6. v. 47. Ioan 3. v. 16. Ioan. 11. v.</hi> 25.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp; euery one that belieueth in the Sonne of God shall not pèrish &amp;c.</hi> Beſides, <hi>He that belieueth in me, although he be dead, shal liue.</hi> Wherefore as this ſatisfyeth in the ſpirituall eating, why ſhould it not alſo ſatisfy in the corporall, by one act and vnder one kind to receaue the authour himſelf, and price of our redemption, without receauing him twiſe, by two ſeuerall acts of eating, and drinking? Becauſe, you will ſay, in the corporall, Chriſt commandeth both: and doth he not ſo in the ſpirituall, ſuppoſing you ſpiritually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his wordes? Or will you ſay, that in the ſpiritual eating of our Redeemer, his death and Paſſion, and by conſequence his body broken, and bloud ſhed, are inuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13611:72"/>
So ſay I, that in the corporal teceauing of one kind, both are not only conſequently inuolued, but perfectly contained: and in the ſole act of eating, the other of drinking, is vertually implyed. Which this very paſſage<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioan. 6. v.</hi> 57.</note> enſuing apparently conuinceth: <hi>He that eateth me, the ſame alſo shall liue by me.</hi> For what doth the word (<hi>me</hi>) compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but the whole perſon of Chriſt, his fleſh, his bloud, his body, his ſoule, his deity, &amp; whatſoeuer els belongs vnto him? Therefore he that eateth only, eateth him, eateth and drinketh all.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But out of the former ſayings of S. Iohn, M. <hi>Bilſon</hi> with his confederates picke a new quarrel, that the wicked according to vs eate Chriſt, yet dye the death of ſinners, therfore our Sauiour ſpeaketh not of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but only of the ſpirituall eating by fayth, by which <hi>we perish not, but liue for euer.</hi> I anſwere, that the former ſentences &amp; many ſuch like are vnderſtood conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he eate worthily, and ſtill perſeuere in that happy ſtate, he ſhal liue for euer; otherwiſe if he eate vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he eateth, as the Apoſtle ſayth, iudgment to himſelfe.<note place="margin">

Therefore this argument of theirs maketh no more againſt the corporal, then ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall feeding; for as euerlaſting life is promiſed to the faythfull and pious belieuer, ſo to the reall and worthy Receauer: and as the one may fall from his worthy dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo the other make ſhipwracke of his liuely fayth, and eternally periſh.

                        <p n="9">9. Secondly I reply, that Chriſt doth not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Euchariſt with <hi>Manna,</hi> in reſpect of the life and death of the ſoule; but of the body alſo, after this ſort. <hi>Manna</hi> could not affoard to your Fathers life of body, much leſſe of ſoule, during their ſhort paſſage through the deſert.

two principal pointes generally denyed by <hi>Fulke</hi> and his Conſorts, I am now to demonſtrate.

                        <p>In one, and the ſame action achieued in the fauour of God, a double valew may be conſidered, the one of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the other of ſatisfaction. The merit is drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worthineſſe of the worke, as it floweth from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of ſupernaturall grace: the ſatisfaction ariſeth from the painfulneſſe, difficulty, or annoyance, which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in performing the ſame. And becauſe euery good and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act of neceſſity beareth this heauenly ſtampe of grace, and is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly attended with ſome paine &amp; difficulty: euery ſuch action is both meritorious of heauen, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory for the delight taken in ſinning, both which it hath pleaſed God to ſet downe by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of his holy will.</p>

Neither is there any reaſon why the ſame worke of prayer, for example, may be meritorious to him that prayeth, and propitiatory in the ſight of God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſome benefit vnto others, if it may not be alſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory for their ſinnes, becauſe the excellency of the worke, from which merit proceedeth, is nothing leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

                        <p>4.

He who kneeleth to his King or Prince dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, agnizeth, and aflectionatly reuerenceth his naturall or Ciuill dignity. He who kneeleth to a Saint, to their Tombes, Reliques, or Pictures, deuoutly apprehendeth, and piouſly worſhipeth ſome ſupernaturall prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,<note place="margin">Three things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the nature of honor.</note> quality, or relation. Wherby it followeth that three thinges concurre to the nature of honour. 1. The apprehenſion of the vnderſtanding which acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth an excellency worthy of adoration. 2. The propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and inclination of the will, which vnfainedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth the ſame with honour. 3. The externall obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of capping, kneeling, or bowing the body which is an outward obſequie of inward reuerence. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the vnderſtanding be the root, origen, or rather motiue which exciteth the will; yet the act of the will is the life, ſoule, and proper eſſence of adoration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the ſole notice and apprehenſion of dignity is no worſhip at all, and the outward and externall action may be as well a ſinne of mockery as any marke of honour.

Out of S. <hi>Paul: We muſt all be conuented before the tribunall ſeat of Christ, that euery one may receaue the proper thinges of his body, according as he hath done good or euill.</hi> Then: <hi>Euery one of vs shall giue an account for himſelfe to God.

Againe: <hi>Their workes follow them:</hi> And not the workes of their friends who remaine behind. Therefore they cannot be relieued by them. Which is confirmed by <hi>King Salomon: The dead know no more, nor haue any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: they haue no part in this world, nor in the worke that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued vnder the heauens.</hi> For which cauſe he counſelleth vs heere, <hi>Diligently to performe whatſoeuer our hand can worke.</hi> Likewiſe by the authority of <hi>S.

                        <p n="27">27. Firſt I ſay, moſt of the former places may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Iudgment in which no help can be expected either from the workes or ſuffrages of others; &amp; of this S. <hi>Hierome</hi> expreſly meaneth. But <hi>King Salomon</hi> in the firſt place ſeemeth to ſpeake only of the temporall goods left behind them in this world, of the benefits of this life, in which the <hi>Dead</hi> haue no ſociety with vs; and not of the ſpirituall workes of <hi>Charity,</hi> of <hi>Prayer, Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds &amp;c.</hi> whereby their ſoules are benefitted. Secondly they may be all interpreted, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doth the firſt teſtimony cited out of the Apoſtle, which he obiecteth<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor. 5. verſ.</hi> 10.</note> to himſelfe: <hi>That euery one may receaue according to his deſerts in the body &amp;c.</hi> that is, according as he merited heere, he ſhall truly enioy in the next life both comfort to himſelfe and profit by the charity of others.

Thirdly, all theſe places may be vnderſtood of the workes of <hi>merit,</hi> not of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> that is, euery one ſhall giue an account for himſelfe in the way of merit, not in the way of ſatisfaction.

And that we may direct our pryers to their behoofe, and apply our charitable workes by intention vnto them is as cleare as that we can intend them vnto the liuing.

Is it an eſſentiall forme which is required to the integrity of fayth? Then fayth alone doth not iuſtify, but Charity alſo, which is eſſentially conioyned and worketh with it. Finally who taught you thus to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite and wound your ſelues, that fayth is the fountaine of ſpirituall life, the roote which ſprouteth from branches of Charity, Hope, and all good Workes, and yet that all the works which proceed from the faythful, be all of their owne nature damnable and deadly ſinnes, all ſtayned with the infection of mortall ſinnes. I would you were once conſtant in your abſurdityes, and mindfull of your leaſings, that we might know where to haue you, and what to refute.</p>

If it be, he is free, and not bound to ſinne; If not, he neceſſarily ſineth and cannot be charged with the imputation of ſinne, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> and experience teacheth. For when a man by his owne inordinate paſſion willingly falleth into a fitte of madneſſe, although after he is once diſtracted, he be worthy of blame for the furious rage which cauſed his diſtraction: yet the enormities he after runneth into not foreſeen before, are neyther faulty nor puniſhable by any vpright law.

ſubſtantially naught, howſoeuer by outward acceptation it may ſeeme beautifull and fayre. Not ſo, ſay they, for our good workes are not wholy euill, not hatefull, not ſinnes, but infected (quoth M.

How then is ſinne intermixed in the good action of marriage? By the ſame act, which inſeparably draweth the ſtayne of corruption with it, or by ſome other adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?<note place="margin">The deſire of taking a wife for a good end in ſuch as may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is free from all ſinne,</note> as by a wicked intention to which it is ordeyned, if by the ſame, one and the ſame action is both good and euill, a ſinne and no ſinne, agreable to reaſon and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable, conſonant and diſſonant to the will of God, the often refuted &amp; vnauoyded implicancy, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre. If by ſome other act or vicious intent, either this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is principall, and the cauſe of marriage, as to marry, the eaſier to contriue the murder of his wife, or ſome other, then the action of marriage is not good, but impious, wicked, and deteſtable: or it is a ſecondary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13611:294"/>
and followeth the deſire of marriage, &amp; ſo it cannot vitiate the former good deſire, nor be termed a ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed therewith: which albeit obſtinate and ignorant aduerſaryes can hardly be drawn to confeſſe, yet will I make it ſo cleare, as they ſhall not be able to deny. Let vs take for example the act of louing God, or dying for his ſake; what mixture hath it, or ſlyme of euill? any ſtayn that ariſeth from the obiect beloued, or will which loueth it? Not from the obiect, for that is infinite goodnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſpot or blemiſh, therefore no blemiſh can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with that act, as it tendeth to ſo pure an obiect: nor from the will of louing it, for no feare of exceſſe, no danger of impurity, can poſſibly flow from deſiring to loue the fountaine it ſelfe, and mayne ſea of purity: not from the mudd of diſtraction, not from the ſcumme of vaine glory, not from the froath of pride, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme may accompany that heauenly loue; for as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the act of loue, ſhould be an act of diſtraction, vanity, pride, or any other then loue, ſo it is impoſſible the ſtaynes of thoſe ſinnefull actions, ſhould be intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed in the act it ſelfe of loue. Doth it proceed from ſome other fleſhly motion, or rebellious inclination? But the<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fleſh infect not the work e of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> motions of the fleſh, do not a whit defile the operations of the ſpirit, they are diſtinct and ſeuerall actions, and theſe without conſent, do not partake of their infection. What is the ſpot then of vncleanes, what is the muddy water this chriſtall riuer of loue, hath drawen from our foule attainted nature? Is it nothing els then the defect, and want of greater perfection, which might be in that act? But thus the loue of many Saints, and Angells, in heauen, ſhould be ſtayned with impurity, becauſe none of the inferiour or lower orders arriue to the burning flames, or loue of the higheſt. Thus the ſinnefull ſpots ſhould not grow from any caſuall and accidentall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but from the ſubſtance it ſelfe of the act, and make the act of loue as it is ſubſtantially leſſe perfect, ſo ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially euill, ſubſtantially naught; both which <hi>M.

If God had his eye leuelled at that alone, it were as much broken in a little as in a greater, as faythfully kept in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſing a ſmall, as in a weighty matter.

Further, our vertues are rewarded as worthy of their hire, but the promiſe of God begetteth not any worthines or dignity in our workes, more then of themſelues belong vnto them. For as our Schoolemen teach: He that ſhall<note place="margin">Gab. Vaſq. in 1. 2. tom. 2. diſp. 214 cap. 5. &amp; others ibid. in q. 114. D. Tho.</note> promiſe a Lordſhip or Dukedome, in behalfe of ſome meane ſeruice, or peece of money of ſmall value; doth not thereby enhaunce the price of the coyne, or eſtimate of his obſequious ſeruice; but the eſtate which is giuen in lieu of that plighted faith, although it require the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſeruice, or payment of the money, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions neceſſary to oblige him that promiſed; yet it doth as much exceed the rate of the one, and deſert of the other, as if no promiſe had beene, no couenaunt made at all. Moreouer the Deuines proue, that if God ſhould threaten to puniſh with eternall paine an officious lye, or other, light offence, that ſinne ſhould not mount thereby to the heynouſnes of a mortall crime, nor be worthy of more puniſhment, then of his owne nature it deſerueth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the commination and threatning of greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Hence the concluſion of my Syllogiſme without checke or controle, is ineuitably inferred: That ſeeing Almighty God portioneth forth a greater, or leſſer ſhare of glory anſwerable to the greatnes, or ſlendernes of our workes, as the hire, wages, or reward of them; he truly remunerateth our pious endeauours, not as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quells of faith, not as meere gifts of grace, but as precedent cauſes, or condigne deſertes of eternall life.

For acception of perſons is a vice, directly oppoſite to diſtributiue iuſtice; as when a Iudge beſtoweth a reward where there is no precedent merit: or when he giueth a more large reward, then the dignity of the merit in any ſort deſerueth.
